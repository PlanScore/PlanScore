Maryland U.S. Congressional Model (version 1)
===

_June 2018_

PlanScore bases its scores on predicted precinct-level votes for Maryland U.S. Congressional races built from past election results and U.S. Census data. To predict future major-party results, we compare precinct-level results from 2016 U.S. Congressional races with the 2016 Clinton/Trump presidential election.

We obtained [results from OpenElections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eig76Z19060TgCidP4lHlEpvsLtmpmPo_79TsuKrk6I) and entered them into our [ordinary least squares regression model](https://github.com/PlanScore/Model-Generator).
