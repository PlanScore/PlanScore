Pennsylvania State Senate Model (version 6)
===

_March 2018_

PlanScore bases its scores on predicted precinct-level votes for Pennsylvania State Senate built from past election results and U.S. Census data. To predict future major-party results, we compare precinct-level results from 2016 State Senate races with the 2016 Clinton/Trump presidential election.

We entered [all 2016 results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sbIRAj_RCT3NX1vG0_vi2obktscy-Skf1kGu8SBxxZc) into our [ordinary least squares regression model](https://github.com/PlanScore/Model-Generator).
