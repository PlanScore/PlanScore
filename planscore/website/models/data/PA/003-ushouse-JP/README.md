Pennsylvania U.S. Congressional Model (version 3)
===

_February 2018_

PlanScore bases its scores on predicted precinct-level votes for Pennsylvania U.S. Congressional built from past election results and U.S. Census data. To predict future major-party results, we compare precinct-level results from 2016 U.S. Congressional races with the 2016 Clinton/Trump presidential election.

This model includes information about incumbent candidates and their plans for the November 2018 election. We developed it as part of [our effort to score Pennsylvaniaâ€™s 2018 remedial plan](https://electionlawblog.org/?p=97606).
