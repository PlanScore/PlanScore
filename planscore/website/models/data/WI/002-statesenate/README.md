Wisconsin State Senate Model (version 2)
===

_March 2018_

PlanScore bases its scores on predicted precinct-level votes for Wisconsin State Senate built from past election results and U.S. Census data. To predict future major-party results, we compare precinct-level results from 2016 State Senate races with the 2016 Clinton/Trump presidential election.

We obtained [results from Wisconsinâ€™s Legislative Technology Services Bureau and OpenElections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBlVmbB6jmOoU_aVeLg3X3BgaoHAUHxn9h2SlveUbh0), and entered them into our [ordinary least squares regression model](https://github.com/PlanScore/Model-Generator).
