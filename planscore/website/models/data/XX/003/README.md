Null Island Parliament Model (version 1)
===

_March 2018_

PlanScore bases its scores on predicted precinct-level votes for Null Island Parliamentary races built from past election results and National Census data. To predict future major-party results, we compare precinct-level results from 2016 Parliamentary races with the 2016 Kang/Kodos presidential election.

We obtained results from OpenElections and entered them into our [ordinary least squares regression model](https://github.com/PlanScore/Model-Generator).
