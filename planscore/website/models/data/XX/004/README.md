Null Island Parliament Model (version 2)
===

_January 2020_

PlanScore bases its scores on predicted precinct-level votes for Null Island Parliamentary races built from past election results and National Census data. To predict future major-party results, we compare precinct-level results from 2016 Parliamentary races with the 2016 Kang/Kodos presidential election.

We obtained results from OpenElections and entered them into our [ordinary least squares regression model](https://github.com/PlanScore/Model-Generator). This model assumes a uniform Â±5% vote swing with incumbent-party candidates.
