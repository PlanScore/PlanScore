    <h1>Historical Data</h1>
    
    <p>
        PlanScore presents estimates of the efficiency gap, partisan bias, and the mean-median difference for congressional and state legislative district plans dating back to 1972. Simon Jackman, Eric McGhee, and Nicholas Stephanopoulos compiled this data in their academic and litigation-related work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not all states and years are included in PlanScore&rsquo;s historical data. Congressional plans with fewer than seven seats (for which partisan asymmetry scores are less reliable) are omitted. So are state legislative plans with very high rates of uncontestedness or with unusual features such as multimember districts or runoffs.
