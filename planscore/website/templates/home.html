            <h2>End Partisan Gerrymandering</h2>
            <p>
                The partisan gridlock we currently see in American politics has resulted in an inability to govern, record low voter turnout and a distrust in government soaring to all-time highs. Contributing to this environment of hyper-partisanship is the practice of partisan gerrymandering, which creates an unrepresentative and unfair democracy and encourages self-interested politics. Partisan gerrymandering undermines the power of voters, has gone on for far too long, and must end.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a democracy, we think that voters can choose their representatives through elections. But, when those representatives get to choose their own districts, we can end up with legislators choosing their voters instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                At PlanScore, we are creating a neutral and objective scoring service for new legislative district plans. Court challenges in North Carolina, Wisconsin, and other states are pushing state legislatures to look beyond simple measures toward effective new standards for symmetry. The same new mapping technologies making it easy for political parties to produce one-sided plans can also help watchdogs ensure plans are fair. The U.S. Constitution requires states to redraw their congressional and state legislative district lines in 2020. Legislative staff, journalists, and voters will need a trusted way to judge the effectiveness of these plans during this critical time.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Our Plan
            </h2>
            <p>
                We are legal, political science, and mapping technology experts tackling the challenge of making redistricting fair and easy to understand. With the help of code and data from election experts around the country, we are building a service to score and publish district plans for all 50 states on an easy-to-use website. [link to some sample NC plans here]
            </p>
            <p>
                To assist legislative staff when creating new plans, any geographic file uploaded by site visitors can be checked for its partisan, demographic, racial, and geometric features and optionally have its score shared publicly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help voters and journalists understand the the characteristics of new plans, the comprehensive score of any district plan published by a legislative majority can be referenced, shared, and linked in articles or social media.
            </p>
            <p>
                To provide historical context for partisan bias in todayâ€™s legislative districts, enacted state plans all the way back to the 1970s will be scored and made available to site visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                PlanScore will be a trusted, non-partisan resource for the redistricting efforts to come in 2018-2021.
