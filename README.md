# PlanScore

Partisan gerrymandering is a deeply undemocratic practice. It produces state
legislatures and congressional delegations that look nothing like the voters
they are meant to represent.

At PlanScore, we will present detailed comparative and historical information
about the partisan asymmetries of past and present district plans. We will also
provide a first-of-its-kind scoring service for new plans, allowing users to
upload maps and instantly receive projected data about their partisan
consequences. Previously, this sort of analysis was available only to the
partiesâ€™ line-drawers. Now it will be accessible to everyone, in the process
transforming the politics, litigation, and coverage of redistricting.

Install for Local Development
---

PlanScore is a Python 3 application deployed to Amazon Web Services with S3 and
Lambda. To make local development possible, use Docker and the local AWS
development stack [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack).

1.  Clone the PlanScore git repository and prepare a
    [Python virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#virtualenv).

2.  Install GDAL 2.1.3, a binary dependency required by PlanScore.
    
    On Mac, [GDAL is gettable from KyngChaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software:frameworks).
    After installing the framework to `/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/2.1`,
    install GDAL with [custom library and include directories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18783390/python-pip-specify-a-library-directory-and-an-include-directory).

        pip3 install \
            --global-option=build_ext \
            --global-option="-I/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/2.1/Headers" \
            --global-option="-L/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/2.1/unix/lib" \
            GDAL==2.1.3
    
3.  Install the rest of PlanScore, keeping it editable, and run the test suite.
    
        pip3 install --editable .
        python3 setup.py test
    
4.  [Download and install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
    
5.  Get a current Docker image with Lambda Python 3.6 runtime environment.
    
        docker pull lambci/lambda:python3.6
    
6.  In its own Python 3 virtual environment, install LocalStack.
    
        pip3 install localstack
    
7.  In a separate window, run LocalStack.
    
        env SERVICES=s3,lambda LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker localstack start
    
    Wait for the expected output.
    
        Starting local dev environment. CTRL-C to quit.
        Starting mock S3 (http port 4572)...
        Starting mock Lambda service (http port 4574)...
        Ready.
    
8.  Build PlanScore dependencies, upload functions to LocalStack Lambda,
    and run the site in debug mode:
    
        make clean localstack-env && ./debug-site.py
