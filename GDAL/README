Compiled GDAL, PROJ.4, and GEOS libraries are needed for reading geodata.
On AWS Lambda, these are packaged into a single tarball using the Dockerfile
here. This script comes from Seth Fitzsimmons's work on OAM Dynamic Tiler with
additional GEOS build as explained by Matthew Perry in a blog post on compiling
code for AWS Lambda.
